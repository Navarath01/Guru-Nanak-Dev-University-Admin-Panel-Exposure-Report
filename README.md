# Guru Nanak Dev University Admin Panel Exposure Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I am an 8th-standard student learning ethical hacking at CADD Centre. During my exploration of websites using Google Dorks, I discovered a security issue related to the Guru Nanak Dev University website.

## Description of the Issue
The admin panel of the university’s website is publicly accessible without authentication. I found the following exposed URL:

`https://www.unextt.net/mockups/admin/administrative.php`

This admin panel should be restricted to authorized users only, as it exposes sensitive areas of the website.

## Steps to Discover
1. I performed a Google Dork search for publicly accessible admin panels.
2. The exposed admin panel URL was discovered.
3. I verified that the URL was accessible without authentication.
